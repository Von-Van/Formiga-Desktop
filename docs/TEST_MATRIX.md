# Release test matrix

Automated checks are the baseline, not a substitute for native desktop testing.

| v1/v2/v3→v4 migration | CI | CI |
| 1,000 genomes × all actions and layered face checks | CI | CI |
| Generated passive-prop determinism and alpha coverage | CI | CI |
| Layered atlas under 1 MB per creature | CI | CI |
| Habitat region algebra | CI | CI |
| Drag state/cancel/landing | CI | CI |
| Alpha-mask and occlusion geometry | CI | CI |
| Update version/asset selection and 24-hour throttle | CI | CI |
